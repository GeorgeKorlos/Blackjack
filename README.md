This repository contains a simple Python implementation of the classic card game Blackjack. The game allows you to play against a computer dealer, following the standard rules of Blackjack. The objective is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer without exceeding 21. The game starts with both the player and the dealer being dealt two cards each. You can choose to draw additional cards or hold your current hand, and the game continues until either the player or the dealer busts or decides to hold. The code uses basic Python functionalities and the random module to simulate card dealing and game logic. Enjoy playing and testing your luck in this digital version of Blackjack!
